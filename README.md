# Hangman

## About the project

A description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned

Aim - Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts. This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 
 
## Features 
- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list for each game.
- Tracks the number of lives the player has.
- Checks validity of user guesses and provides appropriate feedback.
- Updates the display to show correctly guessed letters and their positions.
- Notifies the player of incorrect guesses and reduces the number of lives accordingly.

### User Interaction
Prompt the user to guess a letter.
### Lives Management
The game starts with the player having 5 lives. Each incorrect guess reduces the number of lives by one.
### Feedback Managment
- Correct Guess: If the guessed letter is in the word, the player is informed of the correct guess, and the word display is updated to show the guessed letter in the correct positions.
- Incorrect Guess: If the guessed letter is not in the word, the player is informed of the incorrect guess, and the number of lives is decremented.
- Repeated Guess: If the letter has already been guessed, the player is notified that they have already tried that letter.

### what you have learnt 
- Python basics and advanced, OOP
- imports
- class creation
- using the __init__ method to initialise attributes
- creating methods to check validity of user input and determine if the guess is correct.
